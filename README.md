# Magic 8 Ball

This is a demo project for my portfolio that i created using the experience i got studying on an iOS development course.

Development of this app was a coding challenge in which i applied the use of various swift data types, Interface Builder, motion detection for the response of the device when shaking as well as some Auto Layout settings.
