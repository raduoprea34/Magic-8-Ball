# Magic 8 Ball
This is a demo project for my portfolio that i created using the experience i got studying on an iOS development course.

The app is used as a real magic 8 ball toy which is asked by the person holding it a question with the possible answers of Yes or NO and then shaken to get the result.

Development of this app was a coding challenge in which i applied the use of various swift data types, Interface Builder, motion detection for the response of the device when shaking as well as some Auto Layout settings.
